## Humanlapse showcase website

Tear down version of [PhotoBook Template]() for the Humanlapse Project

* The plan is to reach a fully generic layout and theme with content injection


# Todolist
* CSS is a MESS - factorise CSS properly
* clean Layout of homepage/index page with bad 70vh height in menu component
* what happens when video loads?
* loading for video - lazy loading for entire app ?
* find correct codec ? load first frame and then video ? how to choose qualityyy
